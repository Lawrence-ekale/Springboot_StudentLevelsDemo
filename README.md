# Springboot_StudentLevelsDemo
Demonstrating the communication between layers in springboot.
The controller layer which is the view point, and then the service layer,
which has the business logic and finally the data layer repositories.
The data layer, I have used a jpa and the hibernate implementation. The database used is postgresql
in which is defined in the application properties.

If you would like to run the application then, you have to change the url(if you are using a different type of
database). Then you can change from API to jar then to instance of the application by simply cleaning the code,
then you install using the eclipse or itellij IDE . The jar will be generated which you will run under the target 
path of the project.
